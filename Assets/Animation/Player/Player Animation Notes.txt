NOTE:
The player animations in this folder are MODIFIED versions of the ones in the
RPG Tiny Hero Wave asset pack.

The original animation clips are read-only. The solution I found online was to
duplicate each animation clip file, and then I could modify it. I needed to add
animation triggers to call the OnFootStep() and OnLand() methods in the PlayerController
script, which play the sound effects.
