All of the custom albedo textures in this folder were modified in GIMP
by me as follows:

1. Go to Colors->Hue-Saturation...
2. Set saturation to the maximum possible value and apply.
3. Go to Colors->Brightness-Contrast...
4. Set brightness to 70, contrast to 50, and apply.
5. Export the modified texture.
