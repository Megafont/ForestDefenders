NOTE: 	The structure models were textured in Blender using the textures from the free Cartoon Texture Pack.
	However, in Unity each structure prefab has had all of its materials replaced with the ones in the
	Cartoon Texture Pack. This way, the models are using materials that include not just the albedo map,
	but the AO, height, and metallic maps that come with each texture in that pack.
