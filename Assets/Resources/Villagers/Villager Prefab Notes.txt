NOTE:
The villager prefabs in this folder are MODIFIED versions of the prefabs in the
RPG Tiny Hero Wave asset pack.

Also, each character has a collider component even though the NavMeshAgent
has one of its own. This is because that one doesn't show up as a component
in the Unity Editor. We have to add one so the player will collide properly
with monsters.
