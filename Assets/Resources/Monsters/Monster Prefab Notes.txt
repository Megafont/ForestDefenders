NOTE:
The monster prefabs in this folder are MODIFIED versions of the prefabs in the
RPG Monster Wave asset packs. I may get the full pack later.

Also, each character has a collider component even though the NavMeshAgent
has one of its own. This is because that one doesn't show up as a component
in the Unity Editor. We have to add one so the player will collide properly
with monsters.
