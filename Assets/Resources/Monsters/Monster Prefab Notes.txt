NOTE:
The monster prefabs in this folder are MODIFIED versions of the prefabs in the
RPG Monster Wave asset packs. I may get the full pack later.

Also, each character has a collider component even though the NavMeshAgent
has one of its own. This is because that one doesn't show up as a component
in the Unity Editor. We have to add one so the player will collide properly
with monsters.



CUSTOM ALBEDO TEXTURES:
Note that the original albedo texture is one texture used by all of the monsters
in the given monster pack. Both RPG Monster Wave packs are set up this way.
I created these custom textures to change the colors of a select few monsters
specifically, because I didn't want to just use the included tint shader to
shade the entire texture a given color. These custom textures can be found
in the Assets/Custom Monster Textures folder.
